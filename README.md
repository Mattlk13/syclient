# syclient
A minimal embedded client to SymmetricDS
Currently having lots of trouble getting registered.

HOWTO:
1. Clone, but do NOT open it in IDEA just yet.
2. Manually copy the SymmetricDS librarys from whereever you have them.

    cp -r .../symmetric-server-3.8.16/web/WEB-INF/lib/ conf/web_dir/WEB-INF/

3. Now you can open it in IDEA.
